# Spicy CSV üå∂

Spicy CSV is a CSV to JSON (and back) conversion tool.

This tool provides a ReactJS implementation of the ever popular and super awesome [PapaParse Conversion Library](https://github.com/mholt/PapaParse)

This tool aims to deliver a slick and easy to use UI aimed to simplify the mass conversion of CSV & JSON documents.

All the magic happens in the browser; no more upload size limitations, rubbish scams or server 500 errors!

Made by developers, for developers.
